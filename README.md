# INTROFUCCION
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a Grammy Awards-related
dataset, using modern data science and infrastructure management tools. The dataset was
stored in a PostgreSQL database, where it was accessed and processed using Python.
Airflow was implemented for workflow orchestration, while Docker was used to ensure
environment consistency. Additionally, technologies such as Power BI were used for data
visualization, and GitHub for source code management and version control.
